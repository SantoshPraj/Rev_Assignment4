Q7.Can you pass lambda expressions to a method? When?




ANSWER:




Yes, you can pass lambda expressions as arguments to methods in Java. This is one of the key features introduced in Java 8 to support functional programming constructs.

Lambda expressions can be passed as arguments when a method parameter expects a functional interface type. A functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method. The lambda expression is used to provide an implementation for that single abstract method.

Here's an example to demonstrate passing lambda expressions as method arguments:

```java
interface MyFunction {
    int apply(int x, int y);
}

class Calculator {
    public static int operate(int a, int b, MyFunction function) {
        return function.apply(a, b);
    }
}

public class LambdaExpressionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int result1 = Calculator.operate(5, 3, (x, y) -> x + y);
        System.out.println("Addition: " + result1); // Output: Addition: 8

        int result2 = Calculator.operate(10, 4, (x, y) -> x - y);
        System.out.println("Subtraction: " + result2); // Output: Subtraction: 6
    }
}
```

In this example, we have a functional interface `MyFunction` with a single abstract method `apply()`, as shown in the previous example.

The `Calculator` class has a static method `operate()` that takes two integers and a `MyFunction` instance as arguments. The `operate()` method applies the provided lambda expression (implementation of `MyFunction`) to the given integers.

In the `main` method, we call the `operate()` method of the `Calculator` class and pass lambda expressions as arguments:
- `(x, y) -> x + y` represents a lambda expression that performs addition.
- `(x, y) -> x - y` represents a lambda expression that performs subtraction.

The `operate()` method executes the lambda expression and returns the result, which is then printed in the `main` method.

By passing lambda expressions as method arguments, you can easily customize behavior and provide specific implementations at the call site, promoting code flexibility, reusability, and the ability to work with higher-order functions.
